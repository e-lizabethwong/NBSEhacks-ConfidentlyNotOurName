        <div class="output-detail">Hey there! I saw you got a new printer, and it caught my eye because you got one just two months ago. Knowing about both purchases, it seems like you might have two printer now. Having two so close together might mean you've spent money on something you might not really need right now. It's a good idea to think about whether these purchases fit into your overall plans and priorities. Making sure your spending lines up with your goals is a smart move for your wallet! Have you considered returning the printer?</div>
